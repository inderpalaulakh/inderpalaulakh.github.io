      <description>The book “Don’t make me think” is written by Steve Krug. This is the first book that I read about UX(User Experience Design) design. This book is concise and has four sections.
The “guiding principles” talks about not puzzling the user to find required content. These principles guide to omit needless content, using conventions, images and explains the web page scanning habit of user (not reading complete content).
The section “Things you need to get right” has content to design navigation that helps user to find their way. The big bang theory of web design is about designing home page, using tag lines (nothing beats a good tagline), welcome blurb and testing home page usability.</description>

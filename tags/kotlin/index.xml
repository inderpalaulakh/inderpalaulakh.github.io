      <description>It is very connivent to use any DI framework when all the objects required are available in application. For example, I have two classes Logger, Service and class Middleware is dependent on these classes.
class Logger() class Service() //this class requires Logger &amp;amp; Service object class Middleware(private val logger:Logger. private val service:Service) // middleware object val middleware = Middleware(Logger(),Service())  Dagger can build objects of Logger and Service classes by indicating @Inject annotation to all three classes
internal class Logger @Inject constructor() internal class Service @Inject constructor() //this class requires Logger &amp;amp; Service object internal class Middleware @Inject constructor(private val logger:Logger.</description>

      <description>Below are widely used Dependency Injection frameworks mostly by android &amp;amp; Java application projects.
For Android application development, the suggested Framework by Google are Dagger and Hilt. These frameworks help to avoid writing boilerplate code.
Guice Guice (pronounced &amp;lsquo;juice&amp;rsquo;) is a lightweight dependency injection framework for Java 6 and above, brought to you by Google. (github.com)
With 10K stars this framework is mostly used by Java developers where Java is used for backend &amp;amp; Application development.
For Android, this framework is not suggested as this framework use reflections to scan annotations from code. This requires significant CPU cycles and RAM thus slowdowns application launch.</description>

      <description>Recently, I developed an Android application. The application was developed focusing on simplicity. The application was small thus skipped writing unit tests. I know skipping the unit tests is not a good practice.
In past, I was working on backend projects where tons of unit tests exists for API&amp;rsquo;s. I am new to application development and spent some time to learn about MVC and MVVM design patterns.
For next project, the preference is MVVM. At end of this post I will share the reason to choose MVVM.
The example code for this post is written for Android application.
MVC (Model-View-Controller) Model: Model is data layer.</description>
